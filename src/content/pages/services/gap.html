          <p class="mb-600">In the event your vehicle is deemed a total loss due to an accident or theft, your auto insurance policy will usually cover only the actual cash value or market value of your vehicle less a deductible. This settlement could be significantly less than the amount you owe to your lender or leasing company. The final result is a financial GAP where you must make up the difference, which could mean thousands of dollars out of your pocket.</p>

              <h3 class="text-center fw-semi-bold">PROTECTION THROUGH GUARANTEED AUTO PROTECTION PLUS</h3>
              <p class="">Guaranteed Auto Protection Plus protects individuals who finance a new or used vehicle from the financial GAP.</p>

              <p class="">In the current market, during the first few years that you own your vehicle, your loan/lease balance can be higher than the actual value of your vehicle, as a result of depreciation. As your vehicleâ€™s value declines, your loan/lease balance may decline more slowly, resulting in a financial gap. If your vehicle were stolen or totaled in an accident, you would be liable to pay the difference between your insurance settlement and your outstanding loan/lease balance.</p>

              <p class="">
                <strong><em>Guaranteed Auto Protection Plus</em></strong> covers the difference between the actual cash value of your vehicle and the loan/lease balance, less delinquent payments, late charges, refundable service warranty contracts and other insurance-related charges.
              </p>

              <p class="">
                <strong><em>Guaranteed Auto Protection Plus</em></strong> will even cover your auto insurance deductible up to $500. Ask your loan officer for details.
              </p>
