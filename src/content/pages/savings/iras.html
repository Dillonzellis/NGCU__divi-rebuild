                One of the greatest challenges facing Americans today is ensuring the financial well being and security
                of your family throughout your retirement years. With uncertainty over the adequacy of social security
                growing
                daily, it’s increasingly necessary to rely on your own savings plans and resources to support your
                future retirement plans.

            <p class="fw-regular">At North Georgia Credit Union, we offer 2 main savings accounts geared to help you
                save for your family’s future: <strong>Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.</strong></p>

                are currently
                paying.

            <p class="fw-regular">
                You can move money from one IRA to another of the same type via a transfer or rollover.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-regular">
                A transfer is a direct movement between like IRAs, generally from one financial organization to another,
                but can occur between like IRAs at the same institution. An individual can make only one rollover from
                an IRA to
                another (or the same) IRA in any 12-month period, regardless of the number of IRAs he or she owns. This
                means that an eligible IRA distribution properly rolled over to another IRA, will still get tax-free
                treatment, but
                subsequent distributions from any of the individual’s IRAs received within one year after that
                distribution will not get tax-free rollover treatment. The transfers may be for all or any part of an
                IRA balance.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-regular">
                With a rollover, you, your surviving spouse beneficiary, or your former spouse actually receives the
                money or property through a distribution before rolling it into another IRA. The distribution that is
                eventually rolled
                into an IRA is treated as any other type of distribution at the time it is taken from the IRA. So the
                withholding rules still apply. The distributing financial organization reports the distribution to the
                IRS, and the
                receiving organization reports the rollover contribution to the IRS.

                    Full access to your IRA funds is always guaranteed with a Traditional IRA. Taxable distributions
                    taken from a Traditional IRA before the IRA holder reaches age 59½ are generally subject to a 10%
                    penalty. This is to
                    discourage people from taking distributions prior to reaching age 59½. The 10% early distribution

            <p class="fw-regular">
                Beginning in the year that a Traditional IRA holder turns 72 years of age, distributions from a
                Traditional IRA become mandatory. These distributions are based on your IRA balance divided by your life
                expectancy, either
                singly or jointly with your beneficiary. If you fail to take your required distribution, you will be
                subject to a substantial penalty.

            <p class="fw-regular">
                There are no required minimum distributions due at 70½ years of age as with the Traditional IRA.
                Earnings can continue to grow until you want to take a distribution. However, there are special
                distribution requirements
                when these plans pass to your beneficiaries.
