                <p class=""><strong>Electronic Records.</strong> To facilitate electronic commerce, to reduce the
                    expense of records storage, and to obtain the benefits of faster access to records, you acknowledge
                    and agree that we may in our discretion store all records electronically, and that we will not
                    retain and have no obligation to retain any original documents for any period of time. This applies
                    to all documentation including but not limited to checks, transaction records, notes, mortgages,
                    deeds of trust and other loan and/or security documentation. You further acknowledge and understand

                    storage of documentation via internal processes or third-party processors that we approve for these
                    services. You agree that such storage shall be secure, and further agree that such records shall for
                    all purposes be recognized and admissible in evidence or otherwise to prove the agreements, rights
                    and obligations of the parties pursuant to any such records.</p>


                <p class=""><strong>“E-mail” and Facsimile Communications.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that the
                    Internet is
                    considered inherently insecure. Therefore, you agree that we have no liability to you whatsoever for
                    any loss, claim or damages arising or in any way related to our response(s) to any e-mail or other
                    electronic communication, which we in good faith believe you have submitted to us. We have no duty
                    to investigate the validity or to verify any e-mail or other electronic communication; and may
                    respond to an e-mail at either the address provided with the communication, the e-mail address in
                    your Membership Application and Signature Card, or any other Application or written communication
                    actually received by us. Any account owner, co-borrower, or authorized user may change the e-mail
                    address for statements or other information from us at any time.</p>

                    e-mails or electronic communications. The decision to require authentication is in the sole
                    discretion of North Georgia Credit Union. We will have no obligation, liability or responsibility to
                    you or any other person or company if we do not act upon or follow any instruction to us if a
                    communication cannot be authenticated to our satisfaction. Further, North Georgia Credit Union may
                    not immediately receive e-mail communication that you send. Also, we will not take action based on
                    e-mail requests until we actually receive your message and have a reasonable opportunity to act. We
                    reserve the right to require any notices from you be submitted to us in writing, and we may refuse
                    to send certain information through unsecured e-mail communications. If you need to contact North
                    Georgia Credit Union immediately regarding an unauthorized transaction, stop payment request, or
                    otherwise, you may call North Georgia Credit Union at 706-886-1441, 706-356-7001 or 706-376-6961.
